        <h1>Who Was Julius Caesar?</h1>
        <p>Julius Caesar (born July 12 or 13, 100 BC, died on March 15, 44 BC) was a popular leader of the Roman Republic. He
            waged many campaigns to expand the Roman Republic, and eventually changed it into the Roman Empire. He was supposedly
            a descendant of Trojan prince Aeneas. By the age of 31, Caesar had fought in several wars and become involved
            in Roman politics. After several alliances with the likes of Cleopatra VII, Pompey, and Crassus, he became dictator
            of the Roman Empire. This did not last long, as he died one year later.</p>
        <h1>How and When Did Julius Caesar Die?</h1>
        <p>Julius Caesar was assassinated by his senators on the Ides of March (the 15th), 44 BC. He was due to meet memebers
            of the senate. Just the day before while at dinner, he was asked what kind of death was the best one. He replied,
            "A sudden one". In the morning, his wife begged him not to go to the meeting. She said she had a dream in which
            she held Caesar's dead body. Julius consulted the augurs, who also told him not to go. He decided to not go.
            However, one of his most trusted friends, Brutus, convinced him to go to adjourn the meeting. While traveling
            to the meeting place, a soothsayer that had said previously, "Beware the Ides of March" encountered Caesar. Caesar
            joked, "Well, these are the Ides". The soothsayer replied, "The Ides are not over yet". Caesar was stabbed to
            death by his senators upon entering the hall where the meeting was supposed to take place.</p>

        <h1>Who Killed Caesar?</h1>
        <p>Gaius Cassius Longinus and Marcus Junius Brutus, former enemies of Julius Caesar who'd joined the Roman Senate, led
            Caesar’s assassination, dubbing themselves "the liberators."</p>
        <h1>When and Where Was Julius Caesar Born?</h1>
        <p>While the date has long been disputed, it's estimated that Julius Caesar was born in Rome on July 12 or 13, 100 BC.</p>
        <h1>Family</h1>
        <p>He was born into a patrician family. His family claimed to originate from Alba Longa. His father governed the Roman
            province of Asia and his mother came from an influential family. At the age of 15, his father died, leaving him
            the head of the family.</p>
        <h1>Wife and Children</h1>
        <p>In 84 BC, Julius Caesar married Cornelia, the daughter of a nobleman. Together they had a daughter, Julia Caesaris,
            in 76 B.C. In 69 BC, Cornelia passed away.</p>
        <p>In 67 BC, Caesar married Pompeia, the granddaughter of the Roman dictator Sulla. Their marriage lasted a handful
            of years; in 62 BC, the couple divorced.</p>
        <p>In 59 BC, Caesar married Calpurnia, a teenager to whom he remained married for the rest of his life.</p>
        <h1>Early Life</h1>
        <p>When Caesar was a child, an element of disorder and instability ruled the Roman Republic, which had discredited its
            nobility. Around the time of his father's death, Caesar made a effort to side with the country's nobility.</p>
        <p>Caesar’s marriage to Cornelia made dictator Sulla angry, as Cornelia’s father was Sulla’s political rival. Sulla
            ordered Caesar to divorce Cornelia. If he didnt, he could lose his property. Caesar escaped by joining and serving
            in the military. He first went to the province of Asia and then to Cilicia. Caesar eventually convinced Sulla
            to be allowed to return to Rome.</p>
        <p>After Sulla’s death, Caesar began his career in politics as a prosecuting advocate. He moved temporarily to Rhodes
            to study philosophy. While traveling, he was kidnapped by pirates. He convinced his captors to raise his ransom,
            then organized a naval force to attack them. The pirates were captured and executed.</p>
        <p>Caesar’s reputation increased even more in 74 BC when he put together a private army. He used said army to fight
            Mithradates VI Eupator, king of Pontus, who had declared war on Rome.</p>
        <p>Caesar began working with Pompey. In 68 or 69 BC, he was elected quaestor. He was in charge of public revenue. He
            went on to serve in several other key government positions. In 61 to 60 BC Caesar served as governor of the Roman
            province of Spain. He was elected as consul in 59 BC.</p>
        <h1>First Triumvirate</h1>
        <p>The First Triumvirate was an alliance among Julius Caesar, Marcus Licinius Crassus and Pompey. At the same time Caesar
            was governing under Pompey, he aligned himself with Crassus, a Roman general and politician who served under
            Sulla's rule until his death. Crassus and Pompey, however, were intense rivals. Once again Caesar displayed his
            abilities as a negotiator, earning the trust of both Crassus and Pompey and convincing them they'd be better
            suited as allies instead of enemies.</p>
        <p> Crassus was thought to be the richest Roman. He offered support to Caesar in the form and money and resources. This
            helped Caesar in his rise to power.</p>
        <h1>Early Rule and Gallic Wars</h1>
        <p>Caesar tried to pay off Pompey's soldiers by granting them public lands. Caesar hired some of Pompey's soldiers to
            stage a riot. In the midst of all the chaos, he got his way.</p>
        <p>Not long after, Caesar secured the governorship of Gaul (now France and Belgium). He would use his power to build
            a bigger army and conquer many others. Between 58 and 50 BC, Caesar conquered the rest of Gaul up to the river
            Rhine with his military might.</p>
        <p>As he expanded his reach, Caesar was ruthless with his enemies. In an particularly appaling example, he waited until
            his opponent's water supply had dried up. All the hands of the remaining survivors were cut off. He made sure
            to keep track of the situation in Rome the entire time.</p>
        <h1>War Against Pompey</h1>
        <p>Pompey became jealous of Caesar as he became stronger. Meanwhile, Crassus was still suspicious of Pompey. In 56 BC
            at a conference in Luca, Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus agreed that Caesar would rule the territories for another
            five years, Crassus would have a five-year term in Syria and Pompey a five-year term in Spain. Three years later,
            however, Crassus was killed in a battle in Syria. Around this time Pompey looked at his old concerns about Caesar.</p>
        <p>On January 10 to 11, 49 BC, Caesar led troops across the river Rubicon. As Pompey sided with nobility, civil war
            loomed closer. When Pompey and Caesar fought, Pompey could not stand up to Caesar's army. By late 48 BC, Caesar
            had pushed his enemies out of Italy and pursued Pompey into Egypt. There Pompey was killed, and Caesar allied
            himself with the Egyptian queen Cleopatra.</p>
        <h1>Dictatorship</h1>
        <p>When Caesar returned back to Rome, he was named dictator. However, he would be dictator for just a year before his
            assassination. Caesar greatly transformed the empire, relieving debt and reforming the Senate by increasing its
            size and opening it up so that it better represented all Romans. He changed the Roman calendar and reorganized
            the construction of local government. He rebuilt two city-states, Carthage and Corinth, which had been destroyed
            by his predecessors. And he granted citizenship to a number of foreigners. Some of Caesar's rivals even joined
            the government.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Caesar was also careful to ensure his power and rule. He loaded the Senate with allies and required
            it to grant him honors and titles. He spoke first at assembly meetings, and Roman coins had his face on them.</p>
        <h1>Death</h1>
        <p>The lower and middle class of Rome viewed Caesar in a better light after his reforms. However, his increasing power
            was met with envy and fear in the Roman Senate. They envied his power, and feared he would become king. Caesar's
            inclusion of former Roman enemies in the government helped spell his downfall and assassination by Longinus and
            Brutus.
        </p>
        <h1>After Caesar’s Death</h1>
        <p>After his death, Caesar quickly became a martyr in the new Roman Empire. A mob of lower- and middle-class Romans
            gathered at Caesar's funeral, with the angry crowd attacking the homes of Cassius and Brutus.</p>
        <p>A power struggle ensued in Rome, leading to the end of the Roman Republic. Caesar's great-grandnephew Gaius Octavian
            used Caesar's popularity, to assemble an army against Cassius and Brutus. His victory over Caesar's assassins
            allowed Octavian, who assumed the name Augustus, to take power in 27 BC and become the first Roman emperor.</p>
        <h1>Later Discovery</h1>
        <p>In November 2017, archaeologists announced the discovery of what they believed to be the first evidence of Caesar's
            invasion of Britain in 54 BC.</p>
        <p>While a road was being excavated in Ebbsfleet, Kent, a five-meter-wide defensive ditch and the remains of pottery
            and weapons were found. Experts from the University of Leicester and Kent County Council said the location matched
            up with accounts of the invasion from the time period. They later used this information to pinpoint nearby Pegwell
            Bay as the likely landing spot for Caesar's fleet.</p>
