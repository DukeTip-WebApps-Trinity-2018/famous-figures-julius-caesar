        <h1>Who Was Julius Caesar?</h1>
        <p>Julius Caesar (born July 12 or 13, 100 BC, died on March 15, 44 BC) was a popular leader of the Roman Republic. He
            waged many campaigns to expand the Roman Republic, and eventually changed it into the Roman Emppire. He was supposedly
            a descendant of Trojan prince Aeneas. By the age of 31, Caesar had fought in several wars and become involved
            in Roman politics. After several alliances with the likes of Cleopatra VII, Pompey, and Crassus, he became dictator
            of the Roman Empire. This did not last long, as he died one year later.</p>
        <h1>How and When Did Julius Caesar Die?</h1>
        <p>Julius Caesar was assassinated by his senators on the Ides of March (the 15th), 44 BC. He was due to meet memebers
            of the senate. Just the day before while at dinner, he was asked what kind of death was the best one. He replied,
            "A sudden one". In the morning, his wife begged him not to go to the meeting. She said she had a dream in which
            she held Caesar's dead body. Julius consulted the augurs, who also told him not to go. He decided to not go.
            However, one of his most trusted friends, Brutus, convinced him to go to adjourn the meeting. While traveling
            to the meeting place, a soothsayer that had said previously, "Beware the Ides of March" encountered Caesar. Caesar
            joked, "Well, these are the Ides". The soothsayer replied, "The Ides are not over yet". Caesar was stabbed to
            death by his senators upon entering the hall where the meeting was supposed to take place.</p>

        <h1>Who Killed Caesar?</h1>
        <p>Gaius Cassius Longinus and Marcus Junius Brutus, former enemies of Julius Caesar who'd joined the Roman Senate, led
            Caesar’s assassination, dubbing themselves "the liberators."</p>
        <h1>When and Where Was Julius Caesar Born?</h1>
        <p>While the date has long been disputed, it's estimated that Julius Caesar was born in Rome on July 12 or 13, 100 BC.</p>
        <h1>Family</h1>
        <p>He was born into a patrician family. His family claimed to originate from Alba Longa. His father governed the Roman
            province of Asia and his mother came from an influential family. At the age of 15, his father died, leaving him
            the head of the family.</p>
        <h1>Wife and Children</h1>
        <p>In 84 BC, Julius Caesar married Cornelia, the daughter of a nobleman. Together they had a daughter, Julia Caesaris,
            in 76 B.C. In 69 BC, Cornelia passed away.</p>
        <p>In 67 BC, Caesar married Pompeia, the granddaughter of the Roman dictator Sulla. Their marriage lasted a handful
            of years; in 62 BC, the couple divorced.</p>
        <p>In 59 BC, Caesar married Calpurnia, a teenager to whom he remained married for the rest of his life.</p>
        <h1>Early Life</h1>
        <p>During Caesar’s youth an element of disorder and instability ruled the Roman Republic, which had discredited its
            nobility and seemed unable to handle its considerable size and influence. Around the time of his father's death,
            Caesar made a concerted effort to side with the country's nobility.</p>
        <p>Caesar’s marriage to Cornelia drew the ire of the dictator Sulla, as Cornelia’s father was Sulla’s political rival.
            Sulla ordered Caesar to divorce his wife or risk losing his property. The young Roman refused and escaped by
            serving in the military, first in the province of Asia and then in Cilicia. With the help of influential friends,
            Caesar eventually convinced Sulla to be allowed to return to Rome.</p>
        <p>After Sulla’s death, Caesar began his career in politics as a prosecuting advocate. He relocated temporarily to Rhodes
            to study philosophy. During his travels he was kidnapped by pirates. In a daring display of his negotiation skills
            and counter-insurgency tactics, he convinced his captors to raise his ransom, then organized a naval force to
            attack them. The pirates were captured and executed.</p>
        <p>Caesar’s stature was further enhanced in 74 BC when he put together a private army and combated Mithradates VI Eupator,
            king of Pontus, who had declared war on Rome.</p>
        <p>Caesar began working with Pompey and soon after, in 68 or 69 BC, he was elected quaestor (a base political office).
            He went on to serve in several other key government positions. In 61 to 60 BC Caesar served as governor of the
            Roman province of Spain. Caesar maintained a close alliance with Pompey, which enabled him to get elected as
            consul, a powerful government position, in 59 BC.</p>
        <h1>First Triumvirate</h1>
        <p>The strategic political alliance among Julius Caesar, Marcus Licinius Crassus and Pompey came to be known as the
            First Triumvirate. At the same time Caesar was governing under Pompey, he aligned himself with Crassus, a Roman
            general and politician who served valiantly during Sulla's rule. Crassus and Pompey, however, were intense rivals.
            Once again Caesar displayed his abilities as a negotiator, earning the trust of both Crassus and Pompey and convincing
            them they'd be better suited as allies instead of enemies.</p>
        <p>For Caesar, the First Triumvirate partnership was the perfect springboard to greater domination. Crassus, a leader
            who was cited as the wealthiest man in Roman history, offered Caesar financial and political support that proved
            to be instrumental in his rise to power.</p>
        <h1>Early Rule and Gallic Wars</h1>
        <p>In an early controversial move, Caesar tried to pay off Pompey's soldiers by granting them public lands. Caesar hired
            some of Pompey's soldiers to stage a riot. In the midst of all the chaos, he got his way.</p>
        <p>Not long after, Caesar secured the governorship of Gaul (now France and Belgium). This allowed him to build a bigger
            military and begin the kind of campaigns that would solidify his status as one of Rome's all-time great leaders.
            Between 58 and 50 BC, Caesar conquered the rest of Gaul up to the river Rhine with his extensive military power.</p>
        <p>As he expanded his reach, Caesar was ruthless with his enemies. In one instance he waited until his opponent's water
            supply had dried up, then ordered the hands of all the remaining survivors be cut off. All the while, he was
            mindful of the political scene back home in Rome, hiring key political agents to act on his behalf.</p>
        <h1>War Against Pompey</h1>
        <p>As Julius Caesar’s power and prestige grew, Pompey grew envious of his political partner. Meanwhile, Crassus still
            had never completely overcome his disdain for Pompey. The three leaders patched things up temporarily in 56 BC
            at a conference in Luca, which cemented Caesar's existing territorial rule for another five years, granted Crassus
            a five-year term in Syria and accorded Pompey a five-year term in Spain. Three years later, however, Crassus
            was killed in a battle in Syria. Around this time Pompey revisited his old concerns about Caesar.</p>
        <p>On January 10 to 11, 49 BC, Caesar led troops across the river Rubicon. As Pompey further aligned himself with nobility,
            who increasingly saw Caesar as a national threat, civil war between the two leaders proved to be inevitable.
            In the end, however, Pompey and his troops were no match for Caesar’s military campaign. By late 48 BC, Caesar
            had pushed his enemies out of Italy and pursued Pompey into Egypt. There Pompey was killed, and Caesar aligned
            himself with the Egyptian queen Cleopatra.</p>
        <h1>Dictatorship</h1>
        <p>Upon his return to Rome, Caesar was made dictator for life and hailed as the Father of his Country. Although he would
            serve just a year's term before his assassination, Caesar’s rule proved instrumental in reforming Rome for his
            countrymen. Caesar greatly transformed the empire, relieving debt and reforming the Senate by increasing its
            size and opening it up so that it better represented all Romans. He reformed the Roman calendar and reorganized
            the construction of local government. He resurrected two city-states, Carthage and Corinth, which had been destroyed
            by his predecessors. And he granted citizenship to a number of foreigners. A benevolent victor, Caesar even invited
            some of his defeated rivals to join him in the government.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Caesar was also careful to solidify his power and rule. He stuffed the Senate with allies and required
            it to grant him honors and titles. He spoke first at assembly meetings, and Roman coins bore his face.</p>
        <h1>Death</h1>
        <p>While Caesar's reforms greatly enhanced his standing with Rome's lower- and middle-class populations, his increasing
            power was met with envy, concern and angst in the Roman Senate. A number of politicians saw Caesar as an aspiring
            king. And Romans had no desire for monarchical rule: Legend has it that it had been five centuries since they'd
            last allowed a king to rule them. Caesar's inclusion of former Roman enemies in the government helped spell his
            downfall and assassination by Longinus and Brutus.</p>
        <h1>After Caesar’s Death</h1>
        <p>After his death, Caesar quickly became a martyr in the new Roman Empire. A mob of lower- and middle-class Romans
            gathered at Caesar's funeral, with the angry crowd attacking the homes of Cassius and Brutus. Just two years
            after his death, Caesar became the first Roman figure to be deified. The Senate also gave him the title "The
            Divine Julius."</p>
        <p>A power struggle ensued in Rome, leading to the end of the Roman Republic. Caesar's great-grandnephew Gaius Octavian
            played on the late ruler's popularity, assembling an army to fight back the military troops defending Cassius
            and Brutus. His victory over Caesar's assassins allowed Octavian, who assumed the name Augustus, to take power
            in 27 BC and become the first Roman emperor.</p>
        <h1>Later Discovery</h1>
        <p>In November 2017, archaeologists announced the discovery of what they believed to be the first evidence of Caesar's
            invasion of Britain in 54 BC.</p>
        <p>While a road was being excavated in Ebbsfleet, Kent, a five-meter-wide defensive ditch and the remains of pottery
            and weapons were found. Experts from the University of Leicester and Kent County Council said the location matched
            up with accounts of the invasion from the time period. They later used this information to pinpoint nearby Pegwell
            Bay as the likely landing spot for Caesar's fleet.</p>
